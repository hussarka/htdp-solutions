; The algebra notions what I will learn in this chapter are: variable, function definition, 
; function application, and function composition. There are two kinds of definitions:
; constant definitions, of the shape (define Variable Expression) and function definitions.
; Function definition introduces a new operation on data. Variables arenâ€™t data; they represent data. 
; A function application puts defined functions to work.
